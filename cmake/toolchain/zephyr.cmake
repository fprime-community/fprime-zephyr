# cmake/toolchain/zephyr.cmake:
#
# A toolchain for Zephyr + F Prime integration. It performs the following:
# 1. Sets the FPRIME_PLATFORM to "Zephyr"
# 3. Supplies a function `register_fprime_zephyr_deployment` that registers a deployment/zephyr application

set(FPRIME_PLATFORM Zephyr)

# Function `register_fprime_zephyr_deployment`:
#
# Zephyr expects to build the application in a specific target called `app`. However,
# F Prime's CMake system attaches deployment information to the deployment executable, which
# cannot link in the Zephyr context.
#
# This function provides an alternate deployment registration that allows both build systems
# to work together.
#
# The F Prime deployment is satisfied by:
#  1. `fprime-zephyr-deployment` is created as a library with a single empty source
#  2. `fprime-zephyr-deployment` is registered is set as a "Deployment"
#  3. F Prime custom deployment targets are attached to `fprime-zephyr-deployment`
# 
# Zephyr's `app` target is satisfied by:
# 1. Adding supplied SOURCES to the `app` target
# 2. Registering supplied and default implementations to the `app` target
# 4. Linking `fprime-zephyr-deployment` to the `app` target
#
# This is all wrapped up in a bow by adding a custom target that takes the place of the deployment target
# and builds the final zephyr target and installs the files to the install directory.
#
# Args: 
#    BUILD_TARGET_NAME: name of the build target to register
#    ARGN: see `register_fprime_deployment` for details
